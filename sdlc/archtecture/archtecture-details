The DeerBank App follows a clean, layered architecture.

The Client Layer consists of a React web application running in the browser, which communicates with the backend through HTTPS-based REST APIs.

The Backend Layer is implemented as a Spring Boot application and is structured into four main layers:

     * API Layer – Contains REST controllers for authentication, account management, transfers, and bill payments.
     * Service Layer – Implements business logic through services such as AuthService, AccountService, TransferService, and BillPaymentService.
     * Domain Layer – Defines the core entities and aggregates, including User, Customer, Admin, Account, CheckingAccount, SavingsAccount, Transaction, Payee, BillPayment, OneTimePayment, and RecurringPayment.
     * Persistence Layer – Provides data access through JPA repositories that interact with the database.

A Background Jobs component (Recurring Payment Scheduler) is responsible for periodically triggering the BillPaymentService to process due recurring payments.

For data storage, the application uses a SQL database, which stores customers, accounts, transactions, payees, and bill payment records.
The system also integrates with an Email/Notification Service to deliver confirmations, alerts, and payment receipts to customers.
