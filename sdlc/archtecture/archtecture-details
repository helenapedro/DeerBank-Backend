The DeerBank App follows a layered architecture.
The Client Layer consists of a React web application running in the browser, which communicates with the backend via HTTPS REST APIs.

The Backend Layer is implemented as a Spring Boot application and is organized into four main layers:

an API Layer with REST controllers (Auth, Accounts, Payments),

a Service Layer with business services (AuthService, Account/TransferService, BillPaymentService),

a Domain Layer containing the core entities and aggregates (User, Customer, Admin, Account, Transaction, Payee, BillPayment, OneTimePayment, RecurringPayment),

and a Persistence Layer with JPA repositories that access the database.

A Background Jobs component (Recurring Payment Scheduler) periodically triggers the BillPaymentService to process due recurring payments.
The backend uses a MySQL database hosted on Hostinger to store users, accounts, transactions, payees, and bill payments, and an Email/Notification Service to send confirmations and alerts to customers.
